High Level:
Our goal is to create a program that considers stock market inputs (via  yfinance API)  extracted reddit comments oriented towards politics/current events( via Praw API) and a NLP tool (NLTK module ) that produces meaningful buy/sell signals. We intend on utilizing a dict within a dict to couple stock prices and their respective tickers to an analytical output (generated via the NLTK tool). We then intend on building a data set (potentially using Pandas) of these instances to assess the coorelation between the sentiment analysis output and the stock price. We will then continue to test the coorelation until we reach a suitable level of certainty. Once this is completed, the program can then begin to produce the Buy/Sell signals. These Buy/Sell signals will then also be tested over time to determine the accuracy of our program.  Ultimatley, this will rely mostly on the data sources we choose to implement and our data management/cleansing techniques.
